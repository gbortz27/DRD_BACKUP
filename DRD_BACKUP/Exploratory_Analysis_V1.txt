-- The Distinct Macine Table has a Not Provided code and 2 definitions where word are revesed .. 
--- suggest the correct definition is Tractor Loader Backhoe
--- to conitinue this analysis: Not provided was filled in with a projected value based in deduction - see below
--- The Distinct SM_Stockcodes Have many deficitions of the same thing 
---  It may well be the case that there are many different combinations of vehicles within a class of DISTINCT machines ie sizes 
----- withy the same description.. suggestion is the vehicle is described by the text description with underscore followed by the size underscore units 
------ the text description may wel be an abbreviation ie TLB,ADT,FEL 
---- If 4 X 4 is only a TLB , leave it out as its difficult to type unless discipline of 4 X 4 
------ The reason for getting the text right is to avoid ambiguities under audit and error resolution , TLB's and FELs are mixed up 
----- ADTS and water carts ..these are easy to spot. and may be material to the costs.
--- NOTE:One can jusyt look at the sidebars in the detailed view to spot incomsistences , these are autimated in snowflake .
